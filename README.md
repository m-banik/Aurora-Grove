# Aurora Grove - The Bootstrap Project

## About
A sample tourist resort website made with Bootstrap. A bit more complex project. On main branch you may find also Sass source files- because default Bootstrap colors were customised.

## Resources
The concept is taken from an [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-bootcamp/). The site was it's final project. All graphics are free and taken from the Internet, mostly from [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/).
